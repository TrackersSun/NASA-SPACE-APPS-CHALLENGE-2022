### “The Sun Tracker: a machine learning model that predicts Carrington-like Events using DSCOVR &amp; WIND”


The Sun Tracker algorithm helps to identify the intensity and velocity of those solar winds, being able to warn us of dangerous coronal mass ejections. Thus, preventing damage on earth telecommunications satellites, power lines, GPS systems and other electrical or electronic systems.
